# Diet data analysis
This is my attempt at diet and nutrition data analysis.

Blog: [Diet and Nutrition Data Analysis](https://skth5199.github.io/2022-05-15-Diet-Analytics/)

## Dataset used
The dataset used for this was originally obtained from [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/) and is also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zvikinozadze/myfitnesspal-dataset).

## Derived insights
Insights to aid supermarket in efficient and effective stocking of goods:
* Coffee was the most popular item consumed.
* Banana was the most consumed fruit
* The most popular protein source was chicken breast

Insights about people and nutrition:
* There was a sharp drop during christmas and a dramatic rise on January 1 (New year), which stayed up for 3 months. This was the result of users taking a break during holidays and a large chunk of users starting 3 month diets when the new year began.
* On average, 82% of the users met their goal and 85% were in a calorie deficit.
* The percentage of users that could be considered serious users (logged over 3 months and missed less than 20 days), was 11.11%.
* 20.6% were suspected to be at risk of getting type 2 diabetes.
* Monday was the day when most people started using MyFitnessPal and Wednesday was the least.
